					<h1>Knotting in nanochannel-confined polymers</h1>
					<p>Understanding how knots form and dissipate in polymers is important for the 
					development of nanopore-based DNA sequencers. I investigated this scenario during
					my undergraduate studies, making use of a coarse-grained model to simulate knots
					on a supercomputer. Specifically, I looked at polymers confined geometrically.
					For example, if a knotted polymer is inside a nanotube (a very small tube) then we
					might expect the knot to be less prone to unknot due to Brownian jittering than if 
					the polymer was in free space. This	is because the tube restricts the movement of
					the polymer, and therefore the likelihood for one of the ends to pass through the
					knot and undo itself. This is exactly what I found out. What's more, other forms
					of confinement, such as placing the polymer between two walls, also increase the
					stability of knots.
